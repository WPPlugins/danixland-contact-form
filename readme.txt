A secure, simple yet powerful contact form for your website.

== Description ==

**danixland-contact-form** is a very simple and secure contact form plugin, it provides a shortcode to include your plugin inside a page and you can style it the way you want (it comes with absolutely no styles attached to it). This plugin follows all WordPress security standards and will be continuously improved in order to make it even safer.

This contact form plugin ships with a **working html template** for your emails, and has a filter that allows you to use your own template in case you need it. It's perfect for a customer's website, so that you can give them an email look that's consistent with the look of their website. It makes use of [Genericons](http://genericons.com/ "by Automattic") and ships with the latest version available.

The entire plugin is **translation ready** and ships with an italian translation, together with a .POT file to help you translate it in every language you may need.

= I'd like this plugin to be translated in my language, can you do this for me? =
